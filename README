This project can be used to grant Discourse badges via QRcode scanning or any other URL-providing system

# Project setup

- Create a venv and source it
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- `cp config.toml.sample config.toml`
- Edit config to your needs (see below)
- `flask run`

# Hosting

You'll need somewhere to run this app that your users can reach, so that you
can provide the URL to them. You'll also need to use this URL in the Discourse
config (see below).

# Discourse-side setup

You'll need to generate a secret (I used `pwgen 16 -1`). Head to your Admin >
Settings page and search for `discourse connect provider secrets`. Add a new
host/secret pair using the URL of this webapp and the generated secret.

You'll need an API key (Admin > API > New Key) with the "assign badge to user" scope.

You'll also need to create a badge (Badges > New) and make a note of the badge
ID in the address bar (it's numeric)

# Config file

Using the secrets, keys, etc, you should be able to fill out the config file.
